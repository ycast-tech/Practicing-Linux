Since I am practicing in Ubuntu which is Devian based, APT is already installed by default.
## Installing Suricata
Suricata is an open-source Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) developed by Open Information Security Foundation.
- Install Suricata
To install and remove an an application on Linux you need root permissions, there is a command that gives you root permisions whithout the risk of logging into the root user and potentially cause serious harm to your system. the command is called <code>Sudo</code>, it could make more sense if you see it as "SUper DO".

<code>sudo apt install suricata</code>
